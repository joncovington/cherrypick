# console (unified web UI)

The suite's unified reactive web UI: one app covering every module's read models (overview/watchdog,
MEIC, flies, earnings, GEX) plus scout's interactive surfaces (watchlist, screener, builder,
payoff/POP, staged dry-run tickets). Built to replace the per-module dashboards and scout; during the
transition it runs **in parallel** with them and touches none of their code.

Unlike the rest of the suite this package is **Node + TypeScript**, not Python:

- `shared/` — types shared by server and web (`@console/shared`).
- `server/` — Fastify backend, binds **127.0.0.1:5070** (loopback hard-coded; port via `serve.port`
  in `~/.cherrypick/config/console.json`). Serves the built SPA, `/api/*`, and (from M3) `/ws`.
- `web/` — React + Vite SPA.
- `run.py` — thin launcher (`python run.py dashboard --serve`) so the serve-dashboard command and the
  orchestrator never need to know about the Node toolchain.

## Commands

The one package with a Node toolchain — `pip`/`pytest`/`ruff` do not apply here. From this directory:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build                        # build shared + server + the SPA
pnpm dev:server                   # backend on :5070 with reload
pnpm dev:web                      # Vite on :5173, proxying /api and /ws to :5070
pnpm test                         # vitest
pnpm typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit across all three workspaces
python run.py dashboard --serve   # what the orchestrator and /serve-dashboard invoke
```

## Data rules

- **Read-only over every other package's data.** Module SQLite stores are opened with
  better-sqlite3 `readonly: true`; JSON state is only ever read. The console's sole writable store is
  `~/.cherrypick/data/console/`.
- **Paper/live isolation**: every trade payload carries `mode` taken from its source DB
  (`paper_trades.db` vs the live DB). Mode is never merged across sources or inferred client-side.
- **A module's own evidence window is the default.** Where a module narrows its analytics to a
  current era or study window, the console's reads default to the same narrowing rather than
  showing every row it can reach — MEIC's `CURRENT_ERA` is the case in hand. Earlier eras stay
  reachable through a visible scope control, so widening is a stated choice and never the quiet
  default. Filtering to nothing is reported as a filtered-out result, not an empty page.
- **Market data**: the console opens its own DXLink session via the official `@tastytrade/api` npm
  SDK (`quoteStreamer`). The Python streamer and its `stream_cache.db` are untouched; the cache is
  read read-only as the off-hours / disconnected fallback.
- **Single source of broker auth**: the console reads THE suite credential — the
  `production:client_secret` / `production:refresh_token` entries under the `cherrypick-broker`
  keyring service, the same entries every Python module reads through and onboarding manages.
  Python-keyring targets aren't addressable from Node, so reads bridge through Python
  (`auth/suiteBridge.ts`). **The console never writes credentials** — there is exactly one setting
  path suite-wide, `python -m cherrypick.core.auth setup`; the console CLI's `set` prints that
  pointer, `probe` re-validates on demand, and `clear` touches only the pre-unification Node
  slots. Scope is detected via a dry-run probe (per-process, never persisted): a
  **read-only** refresh token gets a loud warning and every write-oriented function disables
  itself (staged tickets save without broker dry-run validation; the header shows a read-only
  chip). Scope rides on the refresh token.
  **This package contains no order-placement code paths** — staged tickets are dry-run records in the
  console's own store. It never touches any module's `enable_live_trading`.

## Suite guardrails (apply here too)

Instruction files hold no code; account numbers masked to `****1234`; portable paths only
(`os.homedir()` + `path.join`, never a literal user path); human-voice docs/commits; loopback-only
serving; no MCP/network/AI on any reliability path beyond the broker SDK itself.
