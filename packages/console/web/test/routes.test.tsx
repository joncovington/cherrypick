/**
 * Route wiring, rendered rather than read.
 *
 * The case that matters is the catch-all. `<Routes>` with nothing matching renders an empty string,
 * so before this existed an unknown path was a blank screen — no error, no message, no way back,
 * and indistinguishable from a crashed app. That is exactly what a tab left open across a rebuild
 * sees when it asks the old bundle for a route only the new one has.
 *
 * The shell's three client-only stores are stubbed here rather than given server snapshots in
 * production code. They are genuinely browser-only by design — a localStorage mirror and a
 * WebSocket — and `useSyncExternalStore` has no meaningful server value for either, so teaching
 * them one to satisfy a renderer they never run under would be a change to shipping code made for
 * the test's convenience. Stubbing keeps that pressure inside the test file.
