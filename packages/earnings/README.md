# cherrypick-earnings

> **The earnings module of the [cherrypick](../../README.md) suite.** cherrypick is a monorepo of trading
> modules driven by a shared **orchestrator**. This package (`packages/earnings`) is the overnight
> earnings-play engine; its siblings are [`packages/meic`](../meic) (0DTE iron condors) and
> [`packages/orchestrator`](../orchestrator) (the orchestrator). It can run standalone from this folder for
> live / interactive trading, or unattended for paper collection — where the orchestrator drives it by
> subprocess (`cherrypick install`), never by import. See [How this fits the suite](#how-this-fits-the-suite) below.

An autonomous options trading agent for overnight earnings plays. It scans the daily earnings
calendar, evaluates seven defined-risk options strategies against live market data, ranks
candidates, and manages entries and exits around a single overnight hold — position opened once
before the close, closed once after the next open, unmonitored overnight.

Every strategy is **defined-risk**: max loss is known at entry. Undefined-risk/naked strategies
(naked straddles, strangles, naked puts/calls) were deliberately excluded — a single-name
earnings gap on a naked short can blow out arbitrarily overnight with nobody watching.

Shared logic (market calendar, fee schedule) comes from the **`cherrypick.core`** library, vendored per
package as the `src/_core` git submodule — so a fresh clone must pull submodules
(`--recurse-submodules`, or `git submodule update --init --recursive`) before any
`import cherrypick.core...` resolves.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the cherrypick monorepo — --recurse-submodules pulls the shared cherrypick.core (src/_core)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/joncovington/cherrypick.git
cd cherrypick/packages/earnings
# Already cloned without submodules? Run this once: git submodule update --init --recursive

python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
python src/tt.py secrets_set                       # store tastytrade OAuth credentials
python src/tt.py get_connection_status              # confirm "connected": true
```

Every command below is run from inside `packages/earnings`. On macOS/Linux, if `python`/`pip` aren't
found, use `python3`/`pip3` instead.

You'll also need a local `dolt sql-server` serving three DoltHub datasets the scanner reads
live earnings-calendar, IV/RV, and realized-move data from — see
[Installation & Setup](./docs/01-setup.md) for the full walkthrough, including that step.

Once connected, try a no-risk read of tonight's candidates:

```bash
python src/scanner.py get_calendar --date MM/DD/YYYY
python src/strategies/iron_fly.py get_candidates --date MM/DD/YYYY
```

Then run the forced-sampling paper-testing program to validate the whole pipeline end-to-end
(scan → tier → size → cost-adjust → persist → close) without touching a real account:

```
/paper-start
```

Full setup details, troubleshooting, and the first-trade walkthrough are in
[docs/01-setup.md](./docs/01-setup.md).

## How this fits the suite

This package is self-contained — everything else in this README works from `packages/earnings` on its
own. Inside the cherrypick suite it plays two roles:

- **Live / interactive (this package, standalone).** You drive the trading loop and the `/`-commands
  here, in this folder — `/earnings-start` runs `CLAUDE.md`'s Loop Steps, `rank_strategies.py` picks each
  symbol's single best strategy. This is the only path that can place live orders, and only when you set
  `enable_live_trading: true`. The orchestrator never touches it.
- **Unattended paper (orchestrator-orchestrated).** The [orchestrator](../orchestrator) package registers
  and watchdogs two self-healing daily OS tasks — an entry task (15:45 ET) and an exit task (09:45 ET) —
  that run this module's forced-sampling paper harness (`src/strategy_test_runner.py`, `run_entries` /
  `run_closes`) into the isolated `strat_test` book, and reads the resulting `paper_trades.db` — which
  lives in the shared cherrypick data home (`~/.cherrypick/data/earnings` by default) — for
  cross-module reporting. This module has no scheduler of its own. The orchestrator drives it **by
  subprocess only** — it never edits this code or config, never places, cancels, adjusts, or closes an
  order, and never flips `enable_live_trading`. Its one live-config action is onboarding
  (`cherrypick connect` / `account`), which delegates to this module's own credential tool and writes the
  chosen account into this module's `earningsagent` keyring service.

You can run the paper harness here directly too (`/paper-start`); letting the orchestrator manage it just
adds the watchdog, notifications, and the cross-module read side (`cherrypick report` / `dashboard` /
`calibrate`). The shared `cherrypick.core` code (calendar, fees) lives in the `src/_core` submodule — see
[Orchestrator & shared core](CLAUDE.md#orchestrator--shared-core) in `CLAUDE.md` for the exact couplings.

## The 7 Strategies

All defined-risk, all evaluated nightly against live tastytrade chains and DoltHub data:

| Strategy | Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `iron_fly` | Short ATM straddle + long OTM wings | Medium IV, balanced risk/reward |
| `iron_condor` | Short OTM put spread + short OTM call spread | Wide expected range, directional-neutral |
| `directional_credit_spread` | Short OTM put or call spread (side chosen by skew) | Directional bias / IV skew |
| `broken_wing_butterfly` | Asymmetric (skip-strike) butterfly, wings sized to skew | Asymmetric expected moves |
| `reverse_fly` | Long ATM + short OTM wings | Capturing gap premium (long-vol) |
| `atm_calendar` | Short front-month + long back-month, same strike | Low IV, term-structure edge |
| `double_calendar` | ATM calendar on both the call and put side | Low IV, symmetric term structure |

See [docs/05-strategies.md](./docs/05-strategies.md) for full structure, entry conditions, and
exit rules per strategy, and [docs/screening-criteria.md](./docs/screening-criteria.md) for the
shared hard filters and tiering every candidate passes through before a strategy sees it.

---

## How It Works

- **`src/scanner.py`** is the strategy-agnostic engine: earnings calendar, IV/RV ratio, winrate
  backtest, liquidity gates, ranking, expiration selection.
- **`src/strategies/<name>.py`** holds only strategy-specific logic: hard-filter thresholds,
  tiering, strike/order construction. New strategies can be added here without touching the
  shared engine.
- **`src/rank_strategies.py`** evaluates every enabled strategy against every candidate on the
  merged today-AMC/tomorrow-BMO earnings calendar, and picks each symbol's single best strategy.
- **`src/tt.py`** is the tastytrade broker interface — quotes, chains, greeks, account info, and
  (in live mode only) order execution.
- **`src/_core/`** is the shared **`cherrypick.core`** library (git submodule), used here for the market
  calendar and the tastytrade fee schedule (via `src/costs.py`). Module files self-bootstrap `src/_core`
  onto `sys.path` at import, so no pip install is needed — but the submodule must be checked out.
- **`src/paths.py`** resolves the **data home** — the trade ledgers (`earnings_trades.db`,
  `paper_trades.db`) live under `~/.cherrypick/data/earnings` by default (override with
  `EARNINGS_DATA_DIR`), the same managed location the orchestrator reads for cross-module reporting and
  where the local `dolt sql-server` serves the earnings/options/stocks datasets. Only *data* lives there;
  `config/`, `logs/`, and `reports/` stay in the package checkout.

Full operational detail — loop steps, config options, database schema — lives in `CLAUDE.md`,
the authoritative spec this system runs against.

## Paper vs. Live Mode

Controlled by `enable_live_trading` in `config/config.json` (`false` by default):

- **Paper mode**: persistence via `src/db_paper.py`, order handling stops at building the order
  spec — no order is ever submitted. Paper mode still sources live quotes/chains/greeks from the
  real tastytrade session (needed to size and price orders realistically); it just never trades.
- **Live mode**: persistence via `src/db.py`, and entries submit real orders via
  `tt.py execute_trade --live`.

Two separate paper-testing programs exist, and can run concurrently since they write to
isolated books:

- **`/paper-start`** — forced-sampling strategy validation (`src/strategy_test_runner.py`):
  opens every Tier 1/2 candidate for every strategy, not just each symbol's single best, so every
  strategy accumulates a usable sample size quickly. Writes to `profile='strat_test'`.
- **`/paper-trading-start`** — one-shot production-ranking analysis (`rank_strategies.py`): what
  the real loop would pick tonight, without submitting anything.
- **`/earnings-start`** — the actual continuous trading loop (paper or live per
  `enable_live_trading`), run through a full market session.

The forced-sampling close pass writes a deterministic end-of-day file automatically
(`~/.cherrypick/logs/earnings/paper-eod-<date>.md` by default); regenerate or backfill one with
`python src/strategy_test_runner.py eod_report [--date YYYY-MM-DD]`. Track accumulated (multi-day)
results with `python src/strategy_report.py` (text) or `python src/strategy_dashboard.py`
(self-contained HTML dashboard, written to `reports/`).
