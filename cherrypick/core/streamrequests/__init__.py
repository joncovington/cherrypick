"""The consumer side of the streamer's subscription registry.

Every module that reads the shared stream cache declares what it needs by writing one file,
``<state>/stream_requests/<module>.json``; the standalone streamer (``packages/streamer``) reads the
union across every file and streams exactly that. This module owns the WRITE: the path convention, the
symbol cleaning, and the atomic write-then-rename (so a concurrent reader in the streamer never sees a
partial file). It consolidates three byte-similar per-module writers (flies, gex, meic) that each
carried a "candidate to consolidate into cherrypick.core.streamrequests" note — this is that module.

Consumers keep a thin ``stream_request.py`` adapter for their module name, logger, and (MEIC) their
``leg_sources`` spec; the adapter's ``register(config)`` stays best-effort — a failed write must never
break a paper loop or a CLI read, because an unregistered symbol is a data-availability problem the
readers already surface, not a reason to crash.

Payload shape (see ``packages/streamer/src/registry.py``, the reader):
  - ``symbols``: underlyings to stream (spot + ATM window + GEX + opening range).
  - ``legs``: optional explicit static extra streamer-symbols.
  - ``leg_sources``: ``{"db": path, "query": select}`` specs — the streamer opens each DB read-only and
    re-runs the query every subscription poll, treating each non-null result cell as an extra symbol to
    keep subscribed beyond the ATM window (how MEIC keeps its open IC legs fresh).
