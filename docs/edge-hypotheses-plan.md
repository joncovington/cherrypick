# Edge hypotheses: what the 2026-10 video review left worth testing

*Drafted 2026-10-17. Nothing below is built. It follows a review of twenty Theta Profits interviews
(YouTube, 2024-09 to 2026-06) and asks one question of each idea before anything else: **where does
the edge live?** Every item names its hypothesised edge, the claim that would falsify it, the data we
already hold, the smallest test that answers it, and the result that would justify building
anything.*

## The rule this plan follows

A strategy makes money only if something in it survives fair pricing at mid, costs and slippage. That
leaves four places an edge can live:

1. **A risk premium**: variance, skew, term structure. Implied volatility is priced above realised
   on average, and the seller is paid for carrying that risk.
2. **A selection or timing signal**: which names, which days, which minutes. A signal earns only if
   it separates outcomes beyond what the option prices already say.
3. **An execution advantage**: fills, fees, settlement.
4. **A structural or flow effect**: dealer hedging, post-earnings drift, index rebalancing.

Almost everything else in the material reviewed was one of three things that are not edges:

- **Payoff shaping.** Stops, rolls, scaling out, adding wings, "transforming" a position into a
  risk-free one. These move risk between the middle and the tails of the distribution. They change
  the win rate, not the expectancy, unless they exploit something in the list above.
- **Accounting.** Spending profit already booked as a floor. Flies' honesty rules call this an
  `outright` structure: it spends a floor rather than manufacturing one.
- **A sample that paid.** Three months, or one year, in a rising market.

The suite's own negative results all trace to an edge nobody could name. The bwb control
(−$9.1k over two modelled years, no arm profitable from 2011), the navigator spread (−4.3% return on
risk) and the expected-move fly (fair at mid, ~18% costs) all fit that pattern. So every test below is
built to test the **edge claim on its own**, before any management rule is layered on. Management is
treated as variance and tail shaping unless a test shows otherwise.

## Data we already hold

| Source | Coverage | Fit |
|---|---|---|
| SPX 0DTE quote history | ~15 s cadence from 2026-10-13 | Prices intraday structures exactly; ~5 sessions now, 10 by ~10-26. |
| GEX recorder and spot trail | SPX from 2026-07-29; per-strike profile from 10-05 | Intraday spot path, expected move, walls, flip. |
| ThetaData (`packages/backtest`) | Options Standard from 2026-10-17; 1-minute history before 2026 | Years of intraday option prices. **Licensed: results stay under `~/.cherrypick` and never enter this repo, a PR or an artifact.** |
| Dolt clones (`packages/technicals`) | Daily bars 2011→; option chains (sparse pre-2024); earnings events 2020→ | Swing and earnings studies; the navigator study's event set (3,587 priced events). |
| Module ledgers | MEIC `open` arm (no stop, full path); flies, bwb, pmcc, calendars paper books | Paired comparisons against what the modules actually did. |
| Existing replays | `scripts/bwb_history_backtest.py`, `scripts/pmcc_shield_replay.py`, `scripts/earnings_navigator_history.py`, `cherrypick.meic.stop_policies` | Each new rule here is a variant of one of these, not a new harness. |

## The hypotheses, in priority order

Priority weighs two things: how plausible the edge is, and how cheaply our existing data can answer
it.

### 1. Post-earnings drift through a put credit spread

*Source: video 20 (2025-07-20).*

- **Rule as stated:** after the report, on a liquid name in an uptrend that did not drop (a 10–15%
  drop means pass), sell a ~20-delta put spread below the pre-report price, 30–45 DTE, $0.80–1.20
  on 5 wide. Take profit at 50%, stop at 2× credit. Average hold 8 days.
- **Where the edge would live:** a **flow effect**. Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) is one of
  the best-documented anomalies in the literature. A name that gaps up tends to keep drifting the
  same way for weeks. The seller also collects a post-report IV that is still elevated.
- **What would falsify it:** across past events, gap-up names show no better 8–30 day returns than
  the post-report IV prices in. In other words, the put spread's win rate at entry is no better than
  its delta implies.
- **Data:** Dolt earnings events and chains 2020→, the same set the navigator study priced. Daily
  bars for the drift itself.
- **Smallest test:** in two steps.
  1. *Signal only:* for each event, the reaction-day gap and the return from the reaction close to
     +8, +14 and +30 sessions. Bucket by gap sign and size, and by whether the stock held past gaps
     (his 8-report screen). Does the drift exist in our sample, and does the screen sharpen it?
  2. *Structure:* only if step 1 shows drift. Price his exact spread at the reaction close from the
     chain, with real costs and his exits.
- **Build only if:** step 1 shows drift beyond noise in out-of-sample years (not one regime), **and**
  step 2 returns positive after costs over both halves of the sample.
- **Note:** the earnings module enters only before the report today. Its PEAD logic is an exit gate
  (`management.py`: a loser closes the first morning, a winner may carry). A post-report entry would
  be a new strategy, so it's measurement-affecting and waits for a boundary.

### 2. Afternoon entries for MEIC

*Sources: videos 1, 6, 12; our own 10-14 entry-time study.*

- **Rule as stated:** four sources independently prefer entries from about 12:00 ET. Talon uses
  12:00–14:30, the host's best hours are the last three, and MEtF uses 12:30–14:45. Our study found
  12:30 the best single slot.
- **Where the edge would live:** **timing**. The edge is the 0DTE variance premium either way, but
  mornings carry the session's tail risk (open blowups on 09-03, 09-21, 10-05 in our sample) while
  afternoons carry less time for it.
- **What would falsify it:** with a much larger sample, afternoon entries earn no more per unit of
  risk than morning ones after stops.
- **Data:** our study used 36 sessions, with no afternoon crash among them. ThetaData 1-minute
  history gives years.
- **Smallest test:** re-run the entry-time grid (09:45 to 14:45, half-hourly) over ThetaData history.
  Use MEIC's own strike rule and its 0.95× stop priced on the 1-minute path, plus the no-stop case.
  Report net by slot, by year, and the worst session per slot.
- **Build only if:** the afternoon advantage holds in most years, not just on average, and survives
  the worst-session comparison. A window change is measurement-affecting, so it waits for a boundary.

### 3. The mid-morning ATM iron fly

*Sources: video 16 (10:00, opening-range filter), video 18 (10:30, 25% target, 14:30 time exit).*

- **Where the edge would live:** the **intraday variance premium**, harvested early and briefly.
  Video 16 adds a **selection filter**: trade only if price is still inside the first 30 minutes'
  range.
- **What would falsify it:** an ATM fly's decay in the first hours does not beat realised movement
  once fills and four legs of fees are charged. Or the opening-range filter does not separate winning
  days from losing ones.
- **Data:** the quote history prices both exactly, but only from 10-13. ThetaData 1-minute history
  for years.
- **Smallest test:** two fixed rule sets, no discretion.
  - *(a)* Enter at 10:00 if spot sits inside the 09:30–10:00 range. Short at the first strike above
    spot, wings at ± the expected move. Take profit at $0.50 / $1.00, stop when spot reaches the
    wings' break-evens.
  - *(b)* Enter at 10:30, 20-wide wings. Take profit at 25% of credit, else close at 14:30.

  For (a), report the filter's split: days it allowed against days it refused.
- **Build only if:** positive after fills at a realistic fraction of the spread and real fees, in
  most years. For (a), the filter has to beat the unfiltered version. Fills decide this one: the
  targets are a few percent of the credit, so a 25%-to-natural fill assumption alone could flip the
  sign. Run the fill sensitivity first.

### 4. An intraday direction signal: trend (MEtF) against reversion (the expected-move fade)

*Sources: video 12 (MEtF: 1-minute 20/40 EMA picks the side), video 2 (fade a touch of the expected
move).*

- **Where the edge would live:** a **direction signal**. The two videos claim opposite things.
  Momentum says the trend continues for the rest of the day; reversion says the move snaps back once
  it reaches the expected move.
- **What would falsify it:** neither signal predicts the SPX move from entry to the close better than
  a coin flip.
- **Data:** for the signal alone, only SPX intraday prices: the spot trail from 07-29, plus ThetaData
  history if the backtest store carries the index. The spread pricing comes later and only matters if
  a signal exists.
- **Smallest test:** at each MEtF entry time (12:30 to 14:45), the EMA state against the sign of the
  move to the close. At each first touch of the expected move before 13:00, the touch direction
  against the move over the next 30, 60 and 120 minutes. Hit rates, with day-clustered confidence
  intervals.
- **Build only if:** a hit rate clears the break-even of the structure it would drive. That's about
  67% for the fade (risk 1× to make 0.5×); for MEtF's 1:1 stop, whatever its credit and fees imply.
  Our earnings-direction reads came out at 48–49%; this test should be held to the same standard.

### 5. The dynamic PMCC short delta

*Source: video 15, Tom King, the author of the Income Shield pmcc's `shield` arms already run.*

- **Rule as stated:** the weekly short's delta follows the daily 8/21 EMA. 20–30 delta in an
  uptrend, at the money when flat, 60–70 delta in the money in a downtrend.
- **Where the edge would live:** a **trend signal timing net delta**. Selling in the money in a
  downtrend is mostly being less long when the trend turns. The "extrinsic income" framing is
  accounting.
- **What would falsify it:** the 8/21 EMA state does not predict the next week's return on the pmcc
  symbols. If it doesn't, the dynamic short is just a noisier fixed short.
- **Data:** Dolt daily bars 2011→; `scripts/pmcc_shield_replay.py`, which already reproduces the
  shield against Cboe WPUT.
- **Smallest test:** first the signal: EMA state against the next-week return, by symbol, 2011→. Then,
  only if it predicts, his delta schedule as a variant in the shield replay against the fixed 0.70
  short.
- **Build only if:** the signal predicts out of sample on most symbols, and the variant beats the
  fixed short in most windows. That's the bar `shield_hold` had to clear: 11 of 15 windows. Remember
  our study's warning that the short's edge flips sign within ±10% IV. Run the variant across the
  same IV band.

### 6. A down-day entry filter for the put BWB

*Source: video 11 (21 DTE put BWB, 25×50, take profit at 2% of width, enters on down days, avoids
all-time highs).*

- **Where the edge would live:** the **put skew premium**, bought cheaper after a down day, when IV is
  richer and strikes sit further away. His 21 DTE structure and take-profit are payoff shaping on top.
- **What would falsify it:** in our history, BWBs entered after down days do no better than the rest.
  The base structure already has no edge from 2011, so the filter has to create one, not polish one.
- **Data:** `scripts/bwb_history_backtest.py` (VIX9D-scaled smile, daily bars, 2011→).
- **Smallest test:** split the existing backtest's entries by the prior day's SPX return (and by
  distance from the all-time high). Then his 21 DTE take-profit shape as one variant, with the same
  split.
- **Build only if:** the down-day subset is positive after costs in most years. Otherwise the
  structure stays where the 2011→ study left it.

### 7. MEIC stop mechanics: a tighter stop on the surviving side; stops on the short leg only

*Sources: video 1 (Talon: cut the surviving side's stop 10–25% once one side fires), videos 1 and 6
(stop on the short; close the long after).*

- **Where the edge would live:** **nowhere new**. Both reshape the payoff and change how stops fill.
  The underlying edge is the variance premium, and our 10-14 study found the 0.95× stop costs most of
  it at every slot. The only possible gain is in fills (an execution edge): a short-only stop rests at
  the exchange, and the long sometimes keeps gaining for a while after the stop fires.
- **What would falsify it:** the tighter surviving-side stop just trades a slightly higher
  double-stop rate for smaller losses, with no change in net. Short-only stops fill no better than
  our recorded spread stops (median 1.064× trigger, p90 1.23×).
- **Data:** `stop_policies` cannot price either: it keeps each side's running maximum, not the path
  after the first fire. The quote history can (from 10-13), and ThetaData 1-minute history can at
  coarser grain.
- **Smallest test:** re-score the `open` arm's recorded paths under both rules on quote-history
  sessions. Report the drawdown claim (Talon: similar profit, half the drawdown) separately from net.
- **Build only if:** net improves, not just drawdown. A drawdown-only improvement is a sizing choice,
  and should be argued as one.

### 8. Chris Pulver's daily routine

*Source: video 14. Reconstructed from five daily sessions (10-12 to 10-16) in
[pulver-daily-profit-play.md](pulver-daily-profit-play.md). The finding is that the condor is a
resting order far above the market, which fills only when price runs toward a box edge. So the edge
claim is reversion at the expected-move box edge, not the open-to-close variance premium assumed
below. The test plan there supersedes this section.*

- **Where the edge would live:** probably the **0DTE variance premium**, through a no-stop 10-delta
  condor. Our MEIC data agrees that loosening the stop helps, up to the tail. Plus **gap-adjusted
  strike placement**: an expected-move box from open + EM down to prior close − EM. His defense flies
  are payoff shaping. His flies at gamma levels depend on vendor levels, and our GEX tests have been
  negative.
- **What to log per session:**
  - the broker's expected move, the open and the prior close;
  - iron condor time, strikes, width, credit and delta;
  - defense strikes, price and time;
  - fly levels and debits, and what he calls the level;
  - every exit with time, price and reason;
  - the VIX, and any skip or size-down.
- **Then:** after 10–20 sessions, separate the rules from the judgment calls. Test the rule-like
  parts against our recorded quotes and GEX levels on the same days.

## Not worth revisiting

Each of these came up again in the review and is already answered:

| Idea | Why not | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Debit-first fly building (videos 4, 8) | Payoff shaping that pays fees on extra legs | Flies debit-first arms: −$35 gross against $1,979 of fees |
| A cheap single long as a hedge | Paid twice, recovered little | Flies hedge overlay: +$803 → −$4,813 |
| GEX levels as entry signals (videos 5, 7, 14) | No separation in our data | MEIC's negative-GEX gate hurt flies and bwb; bwb `wall` lost everywhere |
| Roll-for-a-credit, never close (video 17) | Wins most weeks, keeps the tail | pmcc roll policy lost to holding on 5 of 6 symbols; a 25-delta SPY spread never collects ⅓ of the width |
| "Risk-free" transforms (videos 4, 13) | Accounting: spends booked profit as the floor | Flies' `outright` honesty rule |
| Pin flies with 1,000%+ average wins (video 5) | Implausible expectancy; fair at mid otherwise | Expected-move fly study |

## Process

- **No module changes come out of this plan directly.** Each test is read-only. It reuses an existing
  replay where one fits, and writes its results under `~/.cherrypick`. That's mandatory for anything
  derived from ThetaData.
- **Declare the pass test before running.** Each "build only if" above is the starting point; tighten
  it before looking at results, as the quote-history replay's decision check did.
- **A positive result becomes a proposal, not an arm.** It names the edge, the evidence and the
  boundary it would land on. Window, stop or entry changes in a running module are
  measurement-affecting and batch to a declared boundary.
- **Record every result in the module's history or experiment log, negative or not.** A clean
  negative closes the question for the next review.
